Made in Unity 2022.3.1f1, using Firebase services

## :notebook: About
This is a prototype of a management platform for the indoor navigation mobile aplication [Navi Assistant](https://github.com/Kazymila/Navi-Assistant). This platform allows mapping and modeling of the indoor environment for the navigation application and configuration of the virtual assistant.

*The mobile application and the management platform are prototypes developed as an undergraduate thesis project to obtain the degree of Civil Engineering in Computer Science at the Universidad de O'Higgins, Rancagua, Chile*

The software is mainly a floor plan editor. As shown in the following video, you can draw the 2D floor plan to generate its 3D model, which will then be used later in the navigation application.

You can add the doors and configure the spaces or rooms, to tell the assistant how to calculate the route to a destination, according to the configuration of this one.

Also, you can add obstacles and view a simulated navigation on the modeled map to see how the navigation will be calculated.

In addition, you can position and generate the QR Codes to locate the user in the environment.

When the map is done, you can save the map in a JSON file to use it in [Navi Assistant](https://github.com/Kazymila/Navi-Assistant) to test it locally or upload the map to a Firestore Database, for use it on a exported aplication.
